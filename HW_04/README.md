# Weather Bot
Weather Bot for Telegram using OWM

# Problem
I need to check weather at any city without additional apps.
So, I created a simple bot and with help of this bot I can do it at any time

# Solution
I used owm-api for getting weather data and telegram-api for easy interaction

# Functions
* /weather [location] - get the current weather at location
* /json [location] - same but it will return information in json format
* /time [continent/city] - will return the time at location (not stable)

# Todo
* Make interaction with bot more comfortable
* add additional functions

# How to deploy
Fork this project and get your API keys for telegram and OWM

* [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)
* [Telegram](https://telegram.me/BotFather)
